emerging synergies in causality and deep generative models: a survey,"In the field of artificial intelligence (AI), the quest to understand and model data-generating processes (DGPs) is of paramount importance. Deep generative models (DGMs) have proven adept in capturing complex data distributions but often fall short in generalization and interpretability. On the other hand, causality offers a structured lens to comprehend the mechanisms driving data generation and highlights the causal-effect dynamics inherent in these processes. While causality excels in interpretability and the ability to extrapolate, it grapples with intricacies of high-dimensional spaces. Recognizing the synergistic potential, we delve into the confluence of causality and DGMs. We elucidate the integration of causal principles within DGMs, investigate causal identification using DGMs, and navigate an emerging research frontier of causality in large-scale generative models, particularly generative large language models (LLMs). We offer insights into methodologies, highlight open challenges, and suggest future directions, positioning our comprehensive review as an essential guide in this swiftly emerging and evolving area.",causality deep generative models
"physics-informed machine learning for data anomaly detection, classification, localization, and mitigation: a review, challenges, and path forward","Advancements in digital automation for smart grids have led to the installation of measurement devices like phasor measurement units (PMUs), micro-PMUs ($\mu$-PMUs), and smart meters. However, a large amount of data collected by these devices brings several challenges as control room operators need to use this data with models to make confident decisions for reliable and resilient operation of the cyber-power systems. Machine-learning (ML) based tools can provide a reliable interpretation of the deluge of data obtained from the field. For the decision-makers to ensure reliable network operation under all operating conditions, these tools need to identify solutions that are feasible and satisfy the system constraints, while being efficient, trustworthy, and interpretable. This resulted in the increasing popularity of physics-informed machine learning (PIML) approaches, as these methods overcome challenges that model-based or data-driven ML methods face in silos. This work aims at the following: a) review existing strategies and techniques for incorporating underlying physical principles of the power grid into different types of ML approaches (supervised/semi-supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning (RL)); b) explore the existing works on PIML methods for anomaly detection, classification, localization, and mitigation in power transmission and distribution systems, c) discuss improvements in existing methods through consideration of potential challenges while also addressing the limitations to make them suitable for real-world applications.",physics-informed anomaly detection
"controllable text summarization: unraveling challenges, approaches, and prospects -- a survey","Generic text summarization approaches often fail to address the specific intent and needs of individual users. Recently, scholarly attention has turned to the development of summarization methods that are more closely tailored and controlled to align with specific objectives and user needs. While a growing corpus of research is devoted towards a more controllable summarization, there is no comprehensive survey available that thoroughly explores the diverse controllable aspects or attributes employed in this context, delves into the associated challenges, and investigates the existing solutions. In this survey, we formalize the Controllable Text Summarization (CTS) task, categorize controllable aspects according to their shared characteristics and objectives, and present a thorough examination of existing methods and datasets within each category. Moreover, based on our findings, we uncover limitations and research gaps, while also delving into potential solutions and future directions for CTS.",text summarization
label-efficient time series representation learning: a review,"The scarcity of labeled data is one of the main challenges of applying deep learning models on time series data in the real world. Therefore, several approaches, e.g., transfer learning, self-supervised learning, and semi-supervised learning, have been recently developed to promote the learning capability of deep learning models from the limited time series labels. In this survey, for the first time, we provide a novel taxonomy to categorize existing approaches that address the scarcity of labeled data problem in time series data based on their dependency on external data sources. Moreover, we present a review of the recent advances in each approach and conclude the limitations of the current works and provide future directions that could yield better progress in the field.",label-efficient time series representation learning
vision transformers for mobile applications: a short survey,"Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance on many Computer Vision Tasks. Unfortunately, deploying these large-scale ViTs is resource-consuming and impossible for many mobile devices. While most in the community are building for larger and larger ViTs, we ask a completely opposite question: How small can a ViT be within the tradeoffs of accuracy and inference latency that make it suitable for mobile deployment? We look into a few ViTs specifically designed for mobile applications and observe that they modify the transformer's architecture or are built around the combination of CNN and transformer. Recent work has also attempted to create sparse ViT networks and proposed alternatives to the attention module. In this paper, we study these architectures, identify the challenges and analyze what really makes a vision transformer suitable for mobile applications. We aim to serve as a baseline for future research direction and hopefully lay the foundation to choose the exemplary vision transformer architecture for your application running on mobile devices.",mobile vision transformers
"a unified survey on anomaly, novelty, open-set, and out-of-distribution detection: solutions and future challenges","Machine learning models often encounter samples that are diverged from the training distribution. Failure to recognize an out-of-distribution (OOD) sample, and consequently assign that sample to an in-class label significantly compromises the reliability of a model. The problem has gained significant attention due to its importance for safety deploying models in open-world settings. Detecting OOD samples is challenging due to the intractability of modeling all possible unknown distributions. To date, several research domains tackle the problem of detecting unfamiliar samples, including anomaly detection, novelty detection, one-class learning, open set recognition, and out-of-distribution detection. Despite having similar and shared concepts, out-of-distribution, open-set, and anomaly detection have been investigated independently. Accordingly, these research avenues have not cross-pollinated, creating research barriers. While some surveys intend to provide an overview of these approaches, they seem to only focus on a specific domain without examining the relationship between different domains. This survey aims to provide a cross-domain and comprehensive review of numerous eminent works in respective areas while identifying their commonalities. Researchers can benefit from the overview of research advances in different fields and develop future methodology synergistically. Furthermore, to the best of our knowledge, while there are surveys in anomaly detection or one-class learning, there is no comprehensive or up-to-date survey on out-of-distribution detection, which our survey covers extensively. Finally, having a unified cross-domain perspective, we discuss and shed light on future lines of research, intending to bring these fields closer together.",out-of-distribution detection

We break down code processing models into general language models represented by the GPT family and specialized models that are specifically pretrained on code, often with tailored objectives. We discuss the relations and differences between these models, and highlight the historical transition of code modeling from statistical models and RNNs to pretrained Transformers and LLMs, which is exactly the same course that had been taken by NLP. We also discuss code-specific features such as AST, CFG, and unit tests, along with their application in training code language models, and identify key challenges and potential future directions in this domain.

In this paper, we aim to summarize the up-to-date development of recent OSR methods, considering their rapid development in recent two or three years. Specifically, we firstly introduce a new taxonomy, under which we comprehensively review the existing DNN-based OSR methods. Then, we compare the performances of some typical and state-of-the-art OSR methods on both coarse-grained datasets and fine-grained datasets under both standard-dataset setting and cross-dataset setting, and further give the analysis of the comparison.

However, the current visual question answering has the problem of language bias, which reduces the robustness of the model and has an adverse impact on the practical application of visual question answering. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive review and analysis of this field for the first time, and classify the existing methods according to three categories, including enhancing visual information, weakening language priors, data enhancement and training strategies. At the same time, the relevant representative methods are introduced, summarized and analyzed in turn. The causes of language bias are revealed and classified.

length extrapolation of transformers: a survey from the perspective of position encoding,"Transformer has taken the natural language processing (NLP) field by storm since birth, owing to its superior ability to model complex dependencies in sequences. Despite the great success of pretrained language models (PLMs) based on Transformer across almost all NLP tasks, they all suffer from a preset length limit and thus can hardly extend this success to longer sequences beyond seen data, namely the length extrapolation problem. Length extrapolation has aroused great interest among researchers, as it is the core feature of human language capacity. To enhance length extrapolation of Transformers, a plethora of methods have been proposed, mostly focusing on extrapolatable position encodings. In this article, we provide an organized and systematical review of these research efforts in a unified notation from a position encoding perspective, aiming to enable the reader to gain a deep understanding of existing methods and provide stimuli for future research.",transformer position encoding
a comprehensive survey of natural language generation advances from the perspective of digital deception,"In recent years there has been substantial growth in the capabilities of systems designed to generate text that mimics the fluency and coherence of human language. From this, there has been considerable research aimed at examining the potential uses of these natural language generators (NLG) towards a wide number of tasks. The increasing capabilities of powerful text generators to mimic human writing convincingly raises the potential for deception and other forms of dangerous misuse. As these systems improve, and it becomes ever harder to distinguish between human-written and machine-generated text, malicious actors could leverage these powerful NLG systems to a wide variety of ends, including the creation of fake news and misinformation, the generation of fake online product reviews, or via chatbots as means of convincing users to divulge private information. In this paper, we provide an overview of the NLG field via the identification and examination of 119 survey-like papers focused on NLG research. From these identified papers, we outline a proposed high-level taxonomy of the central concepts that constitute NLG, including the methods used to develop generalised NLG systems, the means by which these systems are evaluated, and the popular NLG tasks and subtasks that exist. In turn, we provide an overview and discussion of each of these items with respect to current research and offer an examination of the potential roles of NLG in deception and detection systems to counteract these threats. Moreover, we discuss the broader challenges of NLG, including the risks of bias that are often exhibited by existing text generation systems. This work offers a broad overview of the field of NLG with respect to its potential for misuse, aiming to provide a high-level understanding of this rapidly developing area of research.

do llms exhibit human-like response biases? a case study in survey design,"As large language models (LLMs) become more capable, there is growing excitement about the possibility of using LLMs as proxies for humans in real-world tasks where subjective labels are desired, such as in surveys and opinion polling. One widely-cited barrier to the adoption of LLMs is their sensitivity to prompt wording - but interestingly, humans also display sensitivities to instruction changes in the form of response biases. As such, we argue that if LLMs are going to be used to approximate human opinions, it is necessary to investigate the extent to which LLMs also reflect human response biases, if at all. In this work, we use survey design as a case study, where human response biases caused by permutations in wordings of""prompts""have been extensively studied. Drawing from prior work in social psychology, we design a dataset and propose a framework to evaluate whether LLMs exhibit human-like response biases in survey questionnaires. Our comprehensive evaluation of nine models shows that popular open and commercial LLMs generally fail to reflect human-like behavior. These inconsistencies tend to be more prominent in models that have been instruction fine-tuned. Furthermore, even if a model shows a significant change in the same direction as humans, we find that perturbations that are not meant to elicit significant changes in humans may also result in a similar change. These results highlight the potential pitfalls of using LLMs to substitute humans in parts of the annotation pipeline, and further underscore the importance of finer-grained characterizations of model behavior.

image-based indian sign language recognition: a practical review using deep neural networks,"People with vocal and hearing disabilities use sign language to express themselves using visual gestures and signs. Although sign language is a solution for communication difficulties faced by deaf people, there are still problems as most of the general population cannot understand this language, creating a communication barrier, especially in places such as banks, airports, supermarkets, etc. [1]. A sign language recognition(SLR) system is a must to solve this problem. The main focus of this model is to develop a real-time word-level sign language recognition system that would translate sign language to text. Much research has been done on ASL(American sign language). Thus, we have worked on ISL(Indian sign language) to cater to the needs of the deaf and hard-of-hearing community of India[2]. In this research, we provide an Indian Sign Language-based Sign Language recognition system. For this analysis, the user must be able to take pictures of hand movements using a web camera, and the system must anticipate and display the name of the taken picture. The acquired image goes through several processing phases, some of which use computer vision techniques, including grayscale conversion, dilatation, and masking. Our model is trained using a convolutional neural network (CNN), which is then utilized to recognize the images. Our best model has a 99% accuracy rate[3].",sign language recognition
know your self-supervised learning: a survey on image-based generative and discriminative training,"Although supervised learning has been highly successful in improving the state-of-the-art in the domain of image-based computer vision in the past, the margin of improvement has diminished significantly in recent years, indicating that a plateau is in sight. Meanwhile, the use of self-supervised learning (SSL) for the purpose of natural language processing (NLP) has seen tremendous successes during the past couple of years, with this new learning paradigm yielding powerful language models. Inspired by the excellent results obtained in the field of NLP, self-supervised methods that rely on clustering, contrastive learning, distillation, and information-maximization, which all fall under the banner of discriminative SSL, have experienced a swift uptake in the area of computer vision. Shortly afterwards, generative SSL frameworks that are mostly based on masked image modeling, complemented and surpassed the results obtained with discriminative SSL. Consequently, within a span of three years, over $100$ unique general-purpose frameworks for generative and discriminative SSL, with a focus on imaging, were proposed. In this survey, we review a plethora of research efforts conducted on image-oriented SSL, providing a historic view and paying attention to best practices as well as useful software packages. While doing so, we discuss pretext tasks for image-based SSL, as well as techniques that are commonly used in image-based SSL. Lastly, to aid researchers who aim at contributing to image-focused SSL, we outline a number of promising research directions.",image self-supervised learning
testing the effectiveness of saliency-based explainability in nlp using randomized survey-based experiments,"As the applications of Natural Language Processing (NLP) in sensitive areas like Political Profiling, Review of Essays in Education, etc. proliferate, there is a great need for increasing transparency in NLP models to build trust with stakeholders and identify biases. A lot of work in Explainable AI has aimed to devise explanation methods that give humans insights into the workings and predictions of NLP models. While these methods distill predictions from complex models like Neural Networks into consumable explanations, how humans understand these explanations is still widely unexplored. Innate human tendencies and biases can handicap the understanding of these explanations in humans, and can also lead to them misjudging models and predictions as a result. We designed a randomized survey-based experiment to understand the effectiveness of saliency-based Post-hoc explainability methods in Natural Language Processing. The result of the experiment showed that humans have a tendency to accept explanations with a less critical view.",NLP Explainability
digital and physical face attacks: reviewing and one step further,"With the rapid progress over the past five years, face authentication has become the most pervasive biometric recognition method. Thanks to the high-accuracy recognition performance and user-friendly usage, automatic face recognition (AFR) has exploded into a plethora of practical applications over device unlocking, checking-in, and financial payment. In spite of the tremendous success of face authentication, a variety of face presentation attacks (FPA), such as print attacks, replay attacks, and 3D mask attacks, have raised pressing mistrust concerns. Besides physical face attacks, face videos/images are vulnerable to a wide variety of digital attack techniques launched by malicious hackers, causing potential menace to the public at large. Due to the unrestricted access to enormous digital face images/videos and disclosed easy-to-use face manipulation tools circulating on the internet, non-expert attackers without any prior professional skills are able to readily create sophisticated fake faces, leading to numerous dangerous applications such as financial fraud, impersonation, and identity theft. This survey aims to build the integrity of face forensics by providing thorough analyses of existing literature and highlighting the issues requiring further attention. In this paper, we first comprehensively survey both physical and digital face attack types and datasets. Then, we review the latest and most advanced progress on existing counter-attack methodologies and highlight their current limits. Moreover, we outline possible future research directions for existing and upcoming challenges in the face forensics community. Finally, the necessity of joint physical and digital face attack detection has been discussed, which has never been studied in previous surveys.",face authentication
physical adversarial attacks for surveillance: a survey,"Modern automated surveillance techniques are heavily reliant on deep learning methods. Despite the superior performance, these learning systems are inherently vulnerable to adversarial attacks-maliciously crafted inputs that are designed to mislead, or trick, models into making incorrect predictions. An adversary can physically change their appearance by wearing adversarial t-shirts, glasses, or hats or by specific behavior, to potentially avoid various forms of detection, tracking, and recognition of surveillance systems; and obtain unauthorized access to secure properties and assets. This poses a severe threat to the security and safety of modern surveillance systems. This article reviews recent attempts and findings in learning and designing physical adversarial attacks for surveillance applications. In particular, we propose a framework to analyze physical adversarial attacks and provide a comprehensive survey of physical adversarial attacks on four key surveillance tasks: detection, identification, tracking, and action recognition under this framework. Furthermore, we review and analyze strategies to defend against physical adversarial attacks and the methods for evaluating the strengths of the defense. The insights in this article present an important step in building resilience within surveillance systems to physical adversarial attacks.",adversarial attacks
vision language transformers: a survey,"Vision language tasks, such as answering questions about or generating captions that describe an image, are difficult tasks for computers to perform. A relatively recent body of research has adapted the pretrained transformer architecture introduced in \citet{vaswani2017attention} to vision language modeling. Transformer models have greatly improved performance and versatility over previous vision language models. They do so by pretraining models on a large generic datasets and transferring their learning to new tasks with minor changes in architecture and parameter values. This type of transfer learning has become the standard modeling practice in both natural language processing and computer vision. Vision language transformers offer the promise of producing similar advancements in tasks which require both vision and language.

towards segment anything model (sam) for medical image segmentation: a survey,"Due to the flexibility of prompting, foundation models have become the dominant force in the domains of natural language processing and image generation. With the recent introduction of the Segment Anything Model (SAM), the prompt-driven paradigm has entered the realm of image segmentation, bringing with a range of previously unexplored capabilities.

a systematic review of the use of deep learning in satellite imagery for agriculture,"Agricultural research is essential for increasing food production to meet the requirements of an increasing population in the coming decades. Recently, satellite technology has been improving rapidly and deep learning has seen much success in generic computer vision tasks and many application areas which presents an important opportunity to improve analysis of agricultural land. Here we present a systematic review of 150 studies to find the current uses of deep learning on satellite imagery for agricultural research. Although we identify 5 categories of agricultural monitoring tasks, the majority of the research interest is in crop segmentation and yield prediction. We found that, when used, modern deep learning methods consistently outperformed traditional machine learning across most tasks; the only exception was that Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Recurrent Neural Networks did not consistently outperform Random Forests (RF) for yield prediction. The reviewed studies have largely adopted methodologies from generic computer vision, except for one major omission: benchmark datasets are not utilised to evaluate models across studies, making it difficult to compare results. Additionally, some studies have specifically utilised the extra spectral resolution available in satellite imagery, but other divergent properties of satellite images - such as the hugely different scales of spatial patterns - are not being taken advantage of in the reviewed studies.",Agricultural satellite imagery

However, they require large amounts of manual annotations to perform competitively, which is infeasible to scale. To address this, a growing body of research works have recently focused on improving DR performance under low-resource scenarios. These works differ in what resources they require for training and employ a diverse set of techniques. Understanding such differences is crucial for choosing the right technique under a specific low-resource scenario. To facilitate this understanding, we provide a thorough structured overview of mainstream techniques for low-resource DR. Based on their required resources, we divide the techniques into three main categories: (1) only documents are needed; (2) documents and questions are needed; and (3) documents and question-answer pairs are needed. For every technique, we introduce its general-form algorithm, highlight the open issues and pros and cons. Promising directions are outlined for future research.",low-resource dense retrieval

However, the optimal per-layer bit precision that preserves accuracy is not easily found, especially with the abundance of models, datasets, and quantization techniques that creates an enormous search space. In order to tackle this difficulty, a body of literature has emerged recently, and several frameworks that achieved promising accuracy results have been proposed. In this paper, we start by summarizing the quantization techniques used generally in literature. Then, we present a thorough survey of the mixed-precision frameworks, categorized according to their optimization techniques such as reinforcement learning and quantization techniques like deterministic rounding. Furthermore, the advantages and shortcomings of each framework are discussed, where we present a juxtaposition.

domain generalization in computational pathology: survey and guidelines,"Deep learning models have exhibited exceptional effectiveness in Computational Pathology (CPath) by tackling intricate tasks across an array of histology image analysis applications. Nevertheless, the presence of out-of-distribution data (stemming from a multitude of sources such as disparate imaging devices and diverse tissue preparation methods) can cause \emph{domain shift} (DS). DS decreases the generalization of trained models to unseen datasets with slightly different data distributions, prompting the need for innovative \emph{domain generalization} (DG) solutions. Recognizing the potential of DG methods to significantly influence diagnostic and prognostic models in cancer studies and clinical practice, we present this survey along with guidelines on achieving DG in CPath. We rigorously define various DS types, systematically review and categorize existing DG approaches and resources in CPath, and provide insights into their advantages, limitations, and applicability. We also conduct thorough benchmarking experiments with 28 cutting-edge DG algorithms to address a complex DG problem. Our findings suggest that careful experiment design and CPath-specific Stain Augmentation technique can be very effective. However, there is no one-size-fits-all solution for DG in CPath. Therefore, we establish clear guidelines for detecting and managing DS depending on different scenarios. While most of the concepts, guidelines, and recommendations are given for applications in CPath, we believe that they are applicable to most medical image analysis tasks as well.",domain generalization

Firstly, we give brief introduction for the RGBT trackers concluded into this category. Then, a comparison among the existing RGBT trackers on several challenging benchmarks is given statistically. Specifically, MDNet and Siamese architectures are the two mainstream frameworks in the RGBT community, especially the former. Trackers based on MDNet achieve higher performance while Siamese-based trackers satisfy the real-time requirement. In summary, since the large-scale dataset LasHeR is published, the integration of end-to-end framework, e.g., Siamese and Transformer, should be further considered to fulfil the real-time as well as more robust performance. Furthermore, the mathematical meaning should be more considered during designing the network.

Unlike CNNs, capsule networks are designed to explicitly model part-whole hierarchical relationships by using groups of neurons to encode visual entities, and learn the relationships between those entities. Promising early results achieved by capsule networks have motivated the deep learning community to continue trying to improve their performance and scalability across several application areas.

a review of panoptic segmentation for mobile mapping point clouds,"3D point cloud panoptic segmentation is the combined task to (i) assign each point to a semantic class and (ii) separate the points in each class into object instances. Recently there has been an increased interest in such comprehensive 3D scene understanding, building on the rapid advances of semantic segmentation due to the advent of deep 3D neural networks. Yet, to date there is very little work about panoptic segmentation of outdoor mobile-mapping data, and no systematic comparisons. The present paper tries to close that gap. It reviews the building blocks needed to assemble a panoptic segmentation pipeline and the related literature. Moreover, a modular pipeline is set up to perform comprehensive, systematic experiments to assess the state of panoptic segmentation in the context of street mapping. As a byproduct, we also provide the first public dataset for that task, by extending the NPM3D dataset to include instance labels. That dataset and our source code are publicly available. We discuss which adaptations are need to adapt current panoptic segmentation methods to outdoor scenes and large objects. Our study finds that for mobile mapping data, KPConv performs best but is slower, while PointNet++ is fastest but performs significantly worse. Sparse CNNs are in between.

a review of uncertainty calibration in pretrained object detectors,"In the field of deep learning based computer vision, the development of deep object detection has led to unique paradigms (e.g., two-stage or set-based) and architectures (e.g., Faster-RCNN or DETR) which enable outstanding performance on challenging benchmark datasets. Despite this, the trained object detectors typically do not reliably assess uncertainty regarding their own knowledge, and the quality of their probabilistic predictions is usually poor. As these are often used to make subsequent decisions, such inaccurate probabilistic predictions must be avoided. In this work, we investigate the uncertainty calibration properties of different pretrained object detection architectures in a multi-class setting. We propose a framework to ensure a fair, unbiased, and repeatable evaluation and conduct detailed analyses assessing the calibration under distributional changes (e.g., distributional shift and application to out-of-distribution data). Furthermore, by investigating the influence of different detector paradigms, post-processing steps, and suitable choices of metrics, we deliver novel insights into why poor detector calibration emerges. Based on these insights, we are able to improve the calibration of a detector by simply finetuning its last layer.",object detection uncertainty calibration

deep transfer learning for intelligent vehicle perception: a survey,"Deep learning-based intelligent vehicle perception has been developing prominently in recent years to provide a reliable source for motion planning and decision making in autonomous driving. A large number of powerful deep learning-based methods can achieve excellent performance in solving various perception problems of autonomous driving. However, these deep learning methods still have several limitations, for example, the assumption that lab-training (source domain) and real-testing (target domain) data follow the same feature distribution may not be practical in the real world. There is often a dramatic domain gap between them in many real-world cases. As a solution to this challenge, deep transfer learning can handle situations excellently by transferring the knowledge from one domain to another. Deep transfer learning aims to improve task performance in a new domain by leveraging the knowledge of similar tasks learned in another domain before. Nevertheless, there are currently no survey papers on the topic of deep transfer learning for intelligent vehicle perception. To the best of our knowledge, this paper represents the first comprehensive survey on the topic of the deep transfer learning for intelligent vehicle perception. This paper discusses the domain gaps related to the differences of sensor, data, and model for the intelligent vehicle perception.

zero-shot and few-shot learning with knowledge graphs: a comprehensive survey,"Machine learning (ML), especially deep neural networks, has achieved great success, but many of them often rely on a number of labeled samples for supervision. As sufficient labeled training data are not always ready due to, e.g., continuously emerging prediction targets and costly sample annotation in real-world applications, ML with sample shortage is now being widely investigated. Among all these studies, many prefer to utilize auxiliary information including those in the form of knowledge graph (KG) to reduce the reliance on labeled samples. In this survey, we have comprehensively reviewed over 90 articles about KG-aware research for two major sample shortage settings¡ªzero-shot learning (ZSL) where some classes to be predicted have no labeled samples and few-shot learning (FSL) where some classes to be predicted have only a small number of labeled samples that are available.

a survey on mobile edge computing for video streaming: opportunities and challenges,"5G communication brings substantial improvements in the quality of service provided to various applications by achieving higher throughput and lower latency. However, interactive multimedia applications (e.g., ultra high definition video conferencing, 3D and multiview video streaming, crowd-sourced video streaming, cloud gaming, virtual and augmented reality) are becoming more ambitious with high volume and low latency video streams putting strict demands on the already congested networks. Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) is an emerging paradigm that extends cloud computing capabilities to the edge of the network i.e., at the base station level. To meet the latency requirements and avoid the end-to-end communication with remote cloud data centers, MEC allows to store and process video content (e.g., caching, transcoding, pre-processing) at the base stations. Both video on demand and live video streaming can utilize MEC to improve existing services and develop novel use cases, such as video analytics, and targeted advertisements. MEC is expected to reshape the future of video streaming by providing ultra-reliable and low latency streaming (e.g., in augmented reality, virtual reality, and autonomous vehicles), pervasive computing (e.g., in real-time video analytics), and blockchain-enabled architecture for secure live streaming. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of recent developments in MEC-enabled video streaming bringing unprecedented improvement to enable novel use cases.

knowledge-informed molecular learning: a survey on paradigm transfer,"Machine learning, notably deep learning, has significantly propelled molecular investigations within the biochemical sphere. Traditionally, modeling for such research has centered around a handful of paradigms. For instance, the prediction paradigm is frequently deployed for tasks such as molecular property prediction. To enhance the generation and decipherability of purely data-driven models, scholars have integrated biochemical domain knowledge into these molecular study models. This integration has sparked a surge in paradigm transfer, which is solving one molecular learning task by reformulating it as another one. With the emergence of Large Language Models, these paradigms have demonstrated an escalating trend towards harmonized unification.

a survey on physical adversarial attack in computer vision,"Over the past decade, deep learning has revolutionized conventional tasks that rely on hand-craft feature extraction with its strong feature learning capability, leading to substantial enhancements in traditional tasks. However, deep neural networks (DNNs) have been demonstrated to be vulnerable to adversarial examples crafted by malicious tiny noise, which is imperceptible to human observers but can make DNNs output the wrong result. Existing adversarial attacks can be categorized into digital and physical adversarial attacks. The former is designed to pursue strong attack performance in lab environments while hardly remaining effective when applied to the physical world. In contrast, the latter focus on developing physical deployable attacks, thus exhibiting more robustness in complex physical environmental conditions. Recently, with the increasing deployment of the DNN-based system in the real world, strengthening the robustness of these systems is an emergency, while exploring physical adversarial attacks exhaustively is the precondition. To this end, this paper reviews the evolution of physical adversarial attacks against DNN-based computer vision tasks, expecting to provide beneficial information for developing stronger physical adversarial attacks. Specifically, we first proposed a taxonomy to categorize the current physical adversarial attacks and grouped them.

a survey on training challenges in generative adversarial networks for biomedical image analysis,"In biomedical image analysis, the applicability of deep learning methods is directly impacted by the quantity of image data available. This is due to deep learning models requiring large image datasets to provide high-level performance. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have been widely utilized to address data limitations through the generation of synthetic biomedical images. GANs consist of two models. The generator, a model that learns how to produce synthetic images based on the feedback it receives. The discriminator, a model that classifies an image as synthetic or real and provides feedback to the generator. Throughout the training process, a GAN can experience several technical challenges that impede the generation of suitable synthetic imagery. First, the mode collapse problem whereby the generator either produces an identical image or produces a uniform image from distinct input features. Second, the non-convergence problem whereby the gradient descent optimizer fails to reach a Nash equilibrium. Thirdly, the vanishing gradient problem whereby unstable training behavior occurs due to the discriminator achieving optimal classification performance resulting in no meaningful feedback being provided to the generator. These problems result in the production of synthetic imagery that is blurry, unrealistic, and less diverse. To date, there has been no survey article outlining the impact of these technical challenges in the context of the biomedical imagery domain. This work presents a review and taxonomy based on solutions to the training problems of GANs in the biomedical imaging domain. This survey highlights important challenges and outlines future research directions about the training of GANs in the domain of biomedical imagery.",generative adversarial networks
deep learning approaches for seizure video analysis: a review,"Seizure events may manifest as transient disruptions in movement and behavior, and the analysis of these clinical signs, referred to as semiology, is subject to observer variations when specialists evaluate video-recorded events in the clinical setting. To enhance the accuracy and consistency of evaluations, computer-aided video analysis of seizures has emerged as a natural avenue. In the field of medical applications, deep learning and computer vision approaches have driven substantial advancements. Historically, these approaches have been used for disease detection, classification, and prediction using diagnostic data; however, there has been limited exploration of their application in evaluating video-based motion detection in the clinical epileptology setting. While vision-based technologies do not aim to replace clinical expertise, they can significantly contribute to medical decision-making and patient care by providing quantitative evidence and decision support. Behavior monitoring tools offer several advantages such as providing objective information, detecting challenging-to-observe events, reducing documentation efforts, and extending assessment capabilities to areas with limited expertise.

deep learning for cross-domain few-shot visual recognition: a survey,"Deep learning has been highly successful in computer vision with large amounts of labeled data, but struggles with limited labeled training data. To address this, Few-shot learning (FSL) is proposed, but it assumes that all samples (including source and target task data, where target tasks are performed with prior knowledge from source ones) are from the same domain, which is a stringent assumption in the real world. To alleviate this limitation, Cross-domain few-shot learning (CDFSL) has gained attention as it allows source and target data from different domains and label spaces. This paper provides a comprehensive review of CDFSL at the first time, which has received far less attention than FSL due to its unique setup and difficulties. We expect this paper to serve as both a position paper and a tutorial for those doing research in CDFSL. This review first introduces the definition of CDFSL and the issues involved, followed by the core scientific question and challenge.

a comprehensive survey on video saliency detection with auditory information: the audio-visual consistency perceptual is the key!,"Video saliency detection (VSD) aims at fast locating the most attractive objects/things/patterns in a given video clip. Existing VSD-related works have mainly relied on the visual system but paid less attention to the audio aspect. In contrast, our audio system is the most vital complementary part of our visual system. Also, audio-visual saliency detection (AVSD), one of the most representative research topics for mimicking human perceptual mechanisms, is currently in its infancy, and none of the existing survey papers have touched on it, especially from the perspective of saliency detection. Thus, the ultimate goal of this paper is to provide an extensive review to bridge the gap between audio-visual fusion and saliency detection. In addition, as another highlight of this review, we have provided a deep insight into key factors that could directly determine AVSD deep models¡¯ performances. We claim that the audio-visual consistency degree (AVC) ¡ª a long-overlooked issue, can directly influence the effectiveness of using audio to benefit its visual counterpart when performing saliency detection. Moreover, to make the AVC issue more practical and valuable for future followers, we have newly equipped almost all existing publicly available AVSD datasets with additional frame-wise AVC labels. Based on these upgraded datasets, we have conducted extensive quantitative evaluations to ground our claim on the importance of AVC in the AVSD task.

neural collapse: a review on modelling principles and generalization,"Deep classifier neural networks enter the terminal phase of training (TPT) when training error reaches zero and tend to exhibit intriguing Neural Collapse (NC) properties. Neural collapse essentially represents a state at which the within-class variability of final hidden layer outputs is infinitesimally small and their class means form a simplex equiangular tight frame. This simplifies the last layer behaviour to that of a nearest-class center decision rule. Despite the simplicity of this state, the dynamics and implications of reaching it are yet to be fully understood.

However, research shows that it has some potential security vulnerabilities because attackers can manipulate the training process and data source. Such a way can set specific triggers, making the model exhibit expected behaviors that have little inferior influence on the model's performance for primitive tasks, called backdoor attacks. Hence, it could have dire consequences, especially considering that the backdoor attack surfaces are broad. To get a precise grasp and understanding of this problem, a systematic and comprehensive review is required to confront various security challenges from different phases and attack purposes. Additionally, there is a dearth of analysis and comparison of the various emerging backdoor countermeasures in this situation. In this paper, we conduct a timely review of backdoor attacks and countermeasures to sound the red alarm for the NLP security community. According to the affected stage of the machine learning pipeline, the attack surfaces are recognized to be wide and then formalized into three categorizations: attacking pre-trained model with fine-tuning (APMF) or prompt-tuning (APMP), and attacking final model with training (AFMT), where AFMT can be subdivided into different attack aims. Thus, attacks under each categorization are combed. The countermeasures are categorized into two general classes: sample inspection and model inspection. Overall, the research on the defense side is far behind the attack side, and there is no single defense that can prevent all types of backdoor attacks. An attacker can intelligently bypass existing defenses with a more invisible attack. ......",backdoor attacks
adversarial examples in the physical world: a survey,"Deep neural networks (DNNs) have demonstrated high vulnerability to adversarial examples. Besides the attacks in the digital world, the practical implications of adversarial examples in the physical world present significant challenges and safety concerns. However, current research on physical adversarial examples (PAEs) lacks a comprehensive understanding of their unique characteristics, leading to limited significance and understanding. In this paper, we address this gap by thoroughly examining the characteristics of PAEs within a practical workflow encompassing training, manufacturing, and re-sampling processes. By analyzing the links between physical adversarial attacks, we identify manufacturing and re-sampling as the primary sources of distinct attributes and particularities in PAEs. Leveraging this knowledge, we develop a comprehensive analysis and classification framework for PAEs based on their specific characteristics, covering over 100 studies on physical-world adversarial examples. Furthermore, we investigate defense strategies against PAEs and identify open challenges and opportunities for future research. We aim to provide a fresh, thorough, and systematic understanding of PAEs, thereby promoting the development of robust adversarial learning and its application in open-world scenarios.",physical-world adversarial attack
trustworthy clinical ai solutions: a unified review of uncertainty quantification in deep learning models for medical image analysis,"The full acceptance of Deep Learning (DL) models in the clinical field is rather low with respect to the quantity of high-performing solutions reported in the literature. Particularly, end users are reluctant to rely on the rough predictions of DL models. Uncertainty quantification methods have been proposed in the literature as a potential response to reduce the rough decision provided by the DL black box and thus increase the interpretability and the acceptability of the result by the final user. In this review, we propose an overview of the existing methods to quantify uncertainty associated to DL predictions. We focus on applications to medical image analysis, which present specific challenges due to the high dimensionality of images and their quality variability, as well as constraints associated to real-life clinical routine. We then discuss the evaluation protocols to validate the relevance of uncertainty estimates. Finally, we highlight the open challenges of uncertainty quantification in the medical field.",uncertainty quantification
wireless sensor networks anomaly detection using machine learning: a survey,"Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) have become increasingly valuable in various civil/military applications like industrial process control, civil engineering applications such as buildings structural strength monitoring, environmental monitoring, border intrusion, IoT (Internet of Things), and healthcare. However, the sensed data generated by WSNs is often noisy and unreliable, making it a challenge to detect and diagnose anomalies. Machine learning (ML) techniques have been widely used to address this problem by detecting and identifying unusual patterns in the sensed data. This survey paper provides an overview of the state of the art applications of ML techniques for data anomaly detection in WSN domains. We first introduce the characteristics of WSNs and the challenges of anomaly detection in WSNs. Then, we review various ML techniques such as supervised, unsupervised, and semi-supervised learning that have been applied to WSN data anomaly detection. We also compare different ML-based approaches and their performance evaluation metrics. Finally, we discuss open research challenges and future directions for applying ML techniques in WSNs sensed data anomaly detection.",wireless sensor networks
a survey of reinforcement learning from human feedback,"Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) is a variant of reinforcement learning (RL) that learns from human feedback instead of relying on an engineered reward function. Building on prior work on the related setting of preference-based reinforcement learning (PbRL), it stands at the intersection of artificial intelligence and human-computer interaction. This positioning offers a promising avenue to enhance the performance and adaptability of intelligent systems while also improving the alignment of their objectives with human values. The training of Large Language Models (LLMs) has impressively demonstrated this potential in recent years, where RLHF played a decisive role in targeting the model's capabilities toward human objectives. This article provides a comprehensive overview of the fundamentals of RLHF, exploring the intricate dynamics between machine agents and human input. While recent focus has been on RLHF for LLMs, our survey adopts a broader perspective, examining the diverse applications and wide-ranging impact of the technique. We delve into the core principles that underpin RLHF, shedding light on the symbiotic relationship between algorithms and human feedback, and discuss the main research trends in the field. By synthesizing the current landscape of RLHF research, this article aims to provide researchers as well as practitioners with a comprehensive understanding of this rapidly growing field of research.",reinforcement learning human feedback
deep learning driven natural languages text to sql query conversion: a survey,"With the future striving toward data-centric decision-making, seamless access to databases is of utmost importance. There is extensive research on creating an efficient text-to-sql (TEXT2SQL) model to access data from the database. Using a Natural language is one of the best interfaces that can bridge the gap between the data and results by accessing the database efficiently, especially for non-technical users. It will open the doors and create tremendous interest among users who are well versed in technical skills or not very skilled in query languages. Even if numerous deep learning-based algorithms are proposed or studied, there still is very challenging to have a generic model to solve the data query issues using natural language in a real-work scenario. The reason is the use of different datasets in different studies, which comes with its limitations and assumptions. At the same time, we do lack a thorough understanding of these proposed models and their limitations with the specific dataset it is trained on. In this paper, we try to present a holistic overview of 24 recent neural network models studied in the last couple of years, including their architectures involving convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, pointer networks, reinforcement learning, generative models, etc. We also give an overview of the 11 datasets that are widely used to train the models for TEXT2SQL technologies.

Nevertheless, it is still not understood very well how multi-task learning can be implemented based on the relatedness of training tasks. In this survey, we review recent advances of multi-task learning methods in NLP, with the aim of summarizing them into two general multi-task training methods based on their task relatedness: (i) joint training and (ii) multi-step training.

a survey on few-shot knowledge graph completion with structural and commonsense knowledge,"Knowledge graphs (KG) have served as the key component of various natural language processing applications. Commonsense knowledge graphs (CKG) are a special type of KG, where entities and relations are composed of free-form text. However, previous works in KG completion and CKG completion suffer from long-tail relations and newly-added relations which do not have many know triples for training. In light of this, few-shot KG completion (FKGC), which requires the strengths of graph representation learning and few-shot learning, has been proposed to challenge the problem of limited annotated data. In this paper, we comprehensively survey previous attempts on such tasks in the form of a series of methods and applications. Specifically, we first introduce FKGC challenges, commonly used KGs, and CKGs. Then we systematically categorize and summarize existing works in terms of the type of KGs and the methods. Finally, we present applications of FKGC models on prediction tasks in different areas and share our thoughts on future research directions of FKGC.",few-shot knowledge graph completion
"completeness, recall, and negation in open-world knowledge bases: a survey","General-purpose knowledge bases (KBs) are a cornerstone of knowledge-centric AI. Many of them are constructed pragmatically from Web sources, and are thus far from complete. This poses challenges for the consumption as well as the curation of their content. While several surveys target the problem of completing incomplete KBs, the first problem is arguably to know whether and where the KB is incomplete in the first place, and to which degree. In this survey we discuss how knowledge about completeness, recall, and negation in KBs can be expressed, extracted, and inferred. We cover (i) the logical foundations of knowledge representation and querying under partial closed-world semantics; (ii) the estimation of this information via statistical patterns; (iii) the extraction of information about recall from KBs and text; (iv) the identification of interesting negative statements; and (v) relaxed notions of relative recall. This survey is targeted at two types of audiences: (1) practitioners who are interested in tracking KB quality, focusing extraction efforts, and building quality-aware downstream applications; and (2) data management, knowledge base and semantic web researchers who wish to understand the state of the art of knowledge bases beyond the open-world assumption. Consequently, our survey presents both fundamental methodologies and their working, and gives practice-oriented recommendations on how to choose between different approaches for a problem at hand.",general-purpose knowledge bases
a review and roadmap of deep learning causal discovery in different variable paradigms,"Understanding causality helps to structure interventions to achieve specific goals and enables predictions under interventions. With the growing importance of learning causal relationships, causal discovery tasks have transitioned from using traditional methods to infer potential causal structures from observational data to the field of pattern recognition involved in deep learning. The rapid accumulation of massive data promotes the emergence of causal search methods with brilliant scalability. Existing summaries of causal discovery methods mainly focus on traditional methods based on constraints, scores and FCMs, there is a lack of perfect sorting and elaboration for deep learning-based methods, also lacking some considers and exploration of causal discovery methods from the perspective of variable paradigms. Therefore, we divide the possible causal discovery tasks into three types according to the variable paradigm and give the definitions of the three tasks respectively, define and instantiate the relevant datasets for each task and the final causal model constructed at the same time, then reviews the main existing causal discovery methods for different tasks. Finally, we propose some roadmaps from different perspectives for the current research gaps in the field of causal discovery and point out future research directions.",causal discovery
deep neural networks and brain alignment: brain encoding and decoding (survey),"How does the brain represent different modes of information? Can we design a system that automatically understands what the user is thinking? Such questions can be answered by studying brain recordings like functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). As a first step, the neuroscience community has contributed several large cognitive neuroscience datasets related to passive reading/listening/viewing of concept words, narratives, pictures and movies. Encoding and decoding models using these datasets have also been proposed in the past two decades. These models serve as additional tools for basic research in cognitive science and neuroscience. Encoding models aim at generating fMRI brain representations given a stimulus automatically. They have several practical applications in evaluating and diagnosing neurological conditions and thus also help design therapies for brain damage. Decoding models solve the inverse problem of reconstructing the stimuli given the fMRI. They are useful for designing brain-machine or brain-computer interfaces. Inspired by the effectiveness of deep learning models for natural language processing, computer vision, and speech, recently several neural encoding and decoding models have been proposed. In this survey, we will first discuss popular representations of language, vision and speech stimuli, and present a summary of neuroscience datasets. Further, we will review popular deep learning based encoding and decoding architectures and note their benefits and limitations. Finally, we will conclude with a brief summary and discussion about future trends. Given the large amount of recently published work in the `computational cognitive neuroscience' community, we believe that this survey nicely organizes the plethora of work and presents it as a coherent story.",brain encoding and decoding

Consequently, many works proposing GNN systems have emerged throughout the past few years. However, there is an acute lack of overview, categorization, and comparison of such systems. We aim to fill this gap by summarizing and categorizing important methods and techniques for large-scale GNN solutions. Additionally, we establish connections between GNN systems, graph processing systems, and deep learning systems.",graph neural networks
towards open vocabulary learning: a survey,"In the field of visual scene understanding, deep neural networks have made impressive advancements in various core tasks like segmentation, tracking, and detection. However, most approaches operate on the close-set assumption, meaning that the model can only identify pre-defined categories that are present in the training set. Recently, open vocabulary settings were proposed due to the rapid progress of vision language pre-training. These new approaches seek to locate and recognize categories beyond the annotated label space. The open vocabulary approach is more general, practical, and effective compared to weakly supervised and zero-shot settings. This paper provides a thorough review of open vocabulary learning, summarizing and analyzing recent developments in the field. In particular, we begin by comparing it to related concepts such as zero-shot learning, open-set recognition, and out-of-distribution detection. Then, we review several closely related tasks in the case of segmentation and detection, including long-tail problems, few-shot, and zero-shot settings. For the method survey, we first present the basic knowledge of detection and segmentation in close-set as the preliminary knowledge. Next, we examine various scenarios in which open vocabulary learning is used, identifying common design elements and core ideas. Then, we compare the recent detection and segmentation approaches in commonly used datasets and benchmarks.

We aim to provide a roadmap for new and existing researchers a on the landscapes of skeleton-based action recognition for new and existing researchers. To this end, we present a review in the form of a taxonomy on existing works of skeleton-based action recognition. We partition them into four major categories: (1) datasets; (2) extracting spatial features; (3) capturing temporal patterns; (4) improving signal quality. For each method, we provide concise yet informatively-sufficient descriptions. To promote more fair and comprehensive evaluation on existing approaches of skeleton-based action recognition, we collect ANUBIS, a large-scale human skeleton dataset.

when large language models meet citation: a survey,"Citations in scholarly work serve the essential purpose of acknowledging and crediting the original sources of knowledge that have been incorporated or referenced. Depending on their surrounding textual context, these citations are used for different motivations and purposes. Large Language Models (LLMs) could be helpful in capturing these fine-grained citation information via the corresponding textual context, thereby enabling a better understanding towards the literature. Furthermore, these citations also establish connections among scientific papers, providing high-quality inter-document relationships and human-constructed knowledge. Such information could be incorporated into LLMs pre-training and improve the text representation in LLMs. Therefore, in this paper, we offer a preliminary review of the mutually beneficial relationship between LLMs and citation analysis. Specifically, we review the application of LLMs for in-text citation analysis tasks, including citation classification, citation-based summarization, and citation recommendation. We then summarize the research pertinent to leveraging citation linkage knowledge to improve text representations of LLMs via citation prediction, network structure information, and inter-document relationship.

towards out-of-distribution generalization in large-scale astronomical surveys: robust networks learn similar representations,"The generalization of machine learning (ML) models to out-of-distribution (OOD) examples remains a key challenge in extracting information from upcoming astronomical surveys. Interpretability approaches are a natural way to gain insights into the OOD generalization problem. We use Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA), a similarity measure metric of neural network representations, to examine the relationship between representation similarity and performance of pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on the CAMELS Multifield Dataset. We find that when models are robust to a distribution shift, they produce substantially different representations across their layers on OOD data. However, when they fail to generalize, these representations change less from layer to layer on OOD data. We discuss the potential application of similarity representation in guiding model design, training strategy, and mitigating the OOD problem by incorporating CKA as an inductive bias during training.",out-of-distribution generalization

ai-augmented surveys: leveraging large language models and surveys for opinion prediction,"Large language models (LLMs) that produce human-like responses have begun to revolutionize research practices in the social sciences. This paper shows how we can integrate LLMs and social surveys to accurately predict individual responses to survey questions that were not asked before. We develop a novel methodological framework to personalize LLMs by considering the meaning of survey questions derived from their text, the latent beliefs of individuals inferred from their response patterns, and the temporal contexts across different survey periods through fine-tuning LLMs with survey data. Using the General Social Survey from 1972 to 2021, we show that the fine-tuned model based on Alpaca-7b can predict individual responses to survey questions that are partially missing as well as entirely missing. The remarkable prediction capabilities allow us to fill in missing trends with high confidence and pinpoint when public attitudes changed, such as the rising support for same-sex marriage. We discuss practical constraints, socio-demographic representation, and ethical concerns regarding individual autonomy and privacy when using LLMs for opinion prediction. This study demonstrates that LLMs and surveys can mutually enhance each other's capabilities: LLMs broaden survey potential, while surveys improve the alignment of LLMs.",opinion prediction

In this work, we instead focus on low-resource languages and in particular non-standardized low-resource languages. Even within branches of major language families, often considered well-researched, little is known about the extent and type of available resources and what the major NLP challenges are for these language varieties. The first step to address this situation is a systematic survey of available corpora (most importantly, annotated corpora, which are particularly valuable for NLP research). Focusing on Germanic low-resource language varieties, we provide such a survey in this paper. Except for geolocation (origin of speaker or document), we find that manually annotated linguistic resources are sparse and, if they exist, mostly cover morphosyntax. Despite this lack of resources, we observe that interest in this area is increasing: there is active development and a growing research community.

capturing dynamics of information diffusion in sns: a survey of methodology and techniques,"Studying information diffusion in SNS (Social Networks Service) has remarkable significance in both academia and industry. Theoretically, it boosts the development of other subjects such as statistics, sociology, and data mining. Practically, diffusion modeling provides fundamental support for many downstream applications (e.g., public opinion monitoring, rumor source identification, and viral marketing). Tremendous efforts have been devoted to this area to understand and quantify information diffusion dynamics. This survey investigates and summarizes the emerging distinguished works in diffusion modeling. We first put forward a unified information diffusion concept in terms of three components: information, user decision, and social vectors, followed by a detailed introduction of the methodologies for diffusion modeling. And then, a new taxonomy adopting hybrid philosophy (i.e., granularity and techniques) is proposed, and we made a series of comparative studies on elementary diffusion models under our taxonomy from the aspects of assumptions, methods, and pros and cons. We further summarized representative diffusion modeling in special scenarios and significant downstream tasks based on these elementary models. Finally, open issues in this field following the methodology of diffusion modeling are discussed.",Social Networks Service information diffusion

survey on fair reinforcement learning: theory and practice,"Fairness-aware learning aims at satisfying various fairness constraints in addition to the usual performance criteria via data-driven machine learning techniques. Most of the research in fairness-aware learning employs the setting of fair-supervised learning. However, many dynamic real-world applications can be better modeled using sequential decision-making problems and fair reinforcement learning provides a more suitable alternative for addressing these problems. In this article, we provide an extensive overview of fairness approaches that have been implemented via a reinforcement learning (RL) framework. We discuss various practical applications in which RL methods have been applied to achieve a fair solution with high accuracy. We further include various facets of the theory of fair reinforcement learning, organizing them into single-agent RL, multi-agent RL, long-term fairness via RL, and offline learning. Moreover, we highlight a few major issues to explore in order to advance the field of fair-RL, namely - i) correcting societal biases, ii) feasibility of group fairness or individual fairness, and iii) explainability in RL.

In this paper, we discuss the use of gaze behaviour in solving different tasks in natural language processing (NLP) without having to record it at test time. This is because the collection of gaze behaviour is a costly task, both in terms of time and money. Hence, in this paper, we focus on research done to alleviate the need for recording gaze behaviour at run time. We also mention different eye tracking corpora in multiple languages, which are currently available and can be used in natural language processing. We conclude our paper by discussing applications in a domain - education - and how learning gaze behaviour can help in solving the tasks of complex word identification and automatic essay grading.",gaze behaviour

recent few-shot object detection algorithms: a survey with performance comparison,"The generic object detection (GOD) task has been successfully tackled by recent deep neural networks, trained by an avalanche of annotated training samples from some common classes. However, it is still non-trivial to generalize these object detectors to the novel long-tailed object classes, which have only few labeled training samples. To this end, the Few-Shot Object Detection (FSOD) has been topical recently, as it mimics the humans¡¯ ability of learning to learn and intelligently transfers the learned generic object knowledge from the common heavy-tailed to the novel long-tailed object classes. Especially, the research in this emerging field has been flourishing in recent years with various benchmarks, backbones, and methodologies proposed. To review these FSOD works, there are several insightful FSOD survey articles [58, 59, 74, 78] that systematically study and compare them as the groups of fine-tuning/transfer learning and meta-learning methods. In contrast, we review the existing FSOD algorithms from a new perspective under a new taxonomy based on their contributions, i.e., data-oriented, model-oriented, and algorithm-oriented. Thus, a comprehensive survey with performance comparison is conducted on recent achievements of FSOD. Furthermore, we also analyze the technical challenges, the merits and demerits of these methods, and envision the future directions of FSOD. Specifically, we give an overview of FSOD, including the problem definition, common datasets, and evaluation protocols. The taxonomy is then proposed that groups FSOD methods into three types.

"artificial intelligence studies in cartography: a review and synthesis of methods, applications, and ethics","The past decade has witnessed the rapid development of geospatial artificial intelligence (GeoAI) primarily due to the ground-breaking achievements in deep learning and machine learning. A growing number of scholars from cartography have demonstrated successfully that GeoAI can accelerate previously complex cartographic design tasks and even enable cartographic creativity in new ways. Despite the promise of GeoAI, researchers and practitioners have growing concerns about the ethical issues of GeoAI for cartography. In this paper, we conducted a systematic content analysis and narrative synthesis of research studies integrating GeoAI and cartography to summarize current research and development trends regarding the usage of GeoAI for cartographic design. Based on this review and synthesis, we first identify dimensions of GeoAI methods for cartography such as data sources, data formats, map evaluations, and six contemporary GeoAI models, each of which serves a variety of cartographic tasks. These models include decision trees, knowledge graph and semantic web technologies, deep convolutional neural networks, generative adversarial networks, graph neural networks, and reinforcement learning. Further, we summarize seven cartographic design applications where GeoAI have been effectively employed: generalization, symbolization, typography, map reading, map interpretation, map analysis, and map production. We also raise five potential ethical challenges that need to be addressed in the integration of GeoAI for cartography: commodification, responsibility, privacy, bias, and (together) transparency, explainability, and provenance. We conclude by identifying four potential research directions for future cartographic research with GeoAI: GeoAI-enabled active cartographic symbolism, human-in-the-loop GeoAI for cartography, GeoAI-based mapping-as-a-service, and generative GeoAI for cartography.",GeoAI cartography

generative adversarial networks for image augmentation in agriculture: a systematic review,"In agricultural image analysis, optimal model performance is keenly pursued for better fulfilling visual recognition tasks (e.g., image classification, segmentation, object detection and localization), in the presence of challenges with biological variability and unstructured environments. Large-scale, balanced and ground-truthed image datasets, however, are often difficult to obtain to fuel the development of advanced, high-performance models. As artificial intelligence through deep learning is impacting analysis and modeling of agricultural images, data augmentation plays a crucial role in boosting model performance while reducing manual efforts for data preparation, by algorithmically expanding training datasets. Beyond traditional data augmentation techniques, generative adversarial network (GAN) invented in 2014 in the computer vision community, provides a suite of novel approaches that can learn good data representations and generate highly realistic samples. Since 2017, there has been a growth of research into GANs for image augmentation or synthesis in agriculture for improved model performance. This paper presents an overview of the evolution of GAN architectures followed by a systematic review of their application to agriculture (https://github.com/Derekabc/GANs-Agriculture), involving various vision tasks for plant health, weeds, fruits, aquaculture, animal farming, plant phenotyping as well as postharvest detection of fruit defects.

a comprehensive survey on model quantization for deep neural networks in image classification,"Recent advancements in machine learning achieved by Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have been significant. While demonstrating high accuracy, DNNs are associated with a huge number of parameters and computations, which leads to high memory usage and energy consumption. As a result, deploying DNNs on devices with constrained hardware resources poses significant challenges. To overcome this, various compression techniques have been widely employed to optimize DNN accelerators. A promising approach is quantization, in which the full-precision values are stored in low bit-width precision. Quantization not only reduces memory requirements but also replaces high-cost operations with low-cost ones. DNN quantization offers flexibility and efficiency in hardware design, making it a widely adopted technique in various methods. Since quantization has been extensively utilized in previous works, there is a need for an integrated report that provides an understanding, analysis, and comparison of different quantization approaches. Consequently, we present a comprehensive survey of quantization concepts and methods, with a focus on image classification. We describe clustering-based quantization methods and explore the use of a scale factor parameter for approximating full-precision values. Moreover, we thoroughly review the training of a quantized DNN, including the use of a straight-through estimator and quantization regularization. We explain the replacement of floating-point operations with low-cost bitwise operations in a quantized DNN and the sensitivity of different layers in quantization. Furthermore, we highlight the evaluation metrics for quantization methods and important benchmarks in the image classification task. We also present the accuracy of the state-of-the-art methods on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet. This article attempts to make the readers familiar with the basic and advanced concepts of quantization, introduce important works in DNN quantization, and highlight challenges for future research in this field.",model quantization
in search of lost online test-time adaptation: a survey,"In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey on online test-time adaptation (OTTA), a paradigm focused on adapting machine learning models to novel data distributions upon batch arrival. Despite the proliferation of OTTA methods recently, the field is mired in issues like ambiguous settings, antiquated backbones, and inconsistent hyperparameter tuning, obfuscating the real challenges and making reproducibility elusive. For clarity and a rigorous comparison, we classify OTTA techniques into three primary categories and subject them to benchmarks using the potent Vision Transformer (ViT) backbone to discover genuinely effective strategies. Our benchmarks span not only conventional corrupted datasets such as CIFAR-10/100-C and ImageNet-C but also real-world shifts embodied in CIFAR-10.1 and CIFAR-10-Warehouse, encapsulating variations across search engines and synthesized data by diffusion models. To gauge efficiency in online scenarios, we introduce novel evaluation metrics, inclusive of FLOPs, shedding light on the trade-offs between adaptation accuracy and computational overhead. Our findings diverge from existing literature, indicating: (1) transformers exhibit heightened resilience to diverse domain shifts, (2) the efficacy of many OTTA methods hinges on ample batch sizes, and (3) stability in optimization and resistance to perturbations are critical during adaptation, especially when the batch size is 1. Motivated by these insights, we pointed out promising directions for future research. The source code will be made available.",online test-time adaptation

"social fraud detection review: methods, challenges and analysis","Social reviews have dominated the web and become a plausible source of product information. People and businesses use such information for decision-making. Businesses also make use of social information to spread fake information using a single user, groups of users, or a bot trained to generate fraudulent content. Many studies proposed approaches based on user behaviors and review text to address the challenges of fraud detection. To provide an exhaustive literature review, social fraud detection is reviewed using a framework that considers three key components: the review itself, the user who carries out the review, and the item being reviewed. As features are extracted for the component representation, a feature-wise review is provided based on behavioral, text-based features and their combination. With this framework, a comprehensive overview of approaches is presented including supervised, semi-supervised, and unsupervised learning. The supervised approaches for fraud detection are introduced and categorized into two sub-categories; classical, and deep learning. The lack of labeled datasets is explained and potential solutions are suggested.

a conversation is worth a thousand recommendations: a survey of holistic conversational recommender systems,"Conversational recommender systems (CRS) generate recommendations through an interactive process. However, not all CRS approaches use human conversations as their source of interaction data; the majority of prior CRS work simulates interactions by exchanging entity-level information. As a result, claims of prior CRS work do not generalise to real-world settings where conversations take unexpected turns, or where conversational and intent understanding is not perfect. To tackle this challenge, the research community has started to examine holistic CRS, which are trained using conversational data collected from real-world scenarios. Despite their emergence, such holistic approaches are under-explored. We present a comprehensive survey of holistic CRS methods by summarizing the literature in a structured manner. Our survey recognises holistic CRS approaches as having three components: 1) a backbone language model, the optional use of 2) external knowledge, and/or 3) external guidance. We also give a detailed analysis of CRS datasets and evaluation methods in real application scenarios. We offer our insight as to the current challenges of holistic CRS and possible future trends.",conversation recommender systems
a survey on trustworthy recommender systems,"Recommender systems (RS), serving at the forefront of Human-centered AI, are widely deployed in almost every corner of the web and facilitate the human decision-making process.

panoptic segmentation: a review,"Image segmentation for video analysis plays an essential role in different research fields such as smart city, healthcare, computer vision and geoscience, and remote sensing applications. In this regard, a significant effort has been devoted recently to developing novel segmentation strategies; one of the latest outstanding achievements is panoptic segmentation. The latter has resulted from the fusion of semantic and instance segmentation. Explicitly, panoptic segmentation is currently under study to help gain a more nuanced knowledge of the image scenes for video surveillance, crowd counting, self-autonomous driving, medical image analysis, and a deeper understanding of the scenes in general. To that end, we present in this paper the first comprehensive review of existing panoptic segmentation methods to the best of the authors' knowledge.

language model behavior: a comprehensive survey," Transformer language models have received widespread public attention, yet their generated text is often surprising even to NLP researchers. In this survey, we discuss over 250 recent studies of English language model behavior before task-specific fine-tuning. Language models possess basic capabilities in syntax, semantics, pragmatics, world knowledge, and reasoning, but these capabilities are sensitive to specific inputs and surface features. Despite dramatic increases in generated text quality as models scale to hundreds of billions of parameters, the models are still prone to unfactual responses, commonsense errors, memorized text, and social biases. Many of these weaknesses can be framed as over-generalizations or under-generalizations of learned patterns in text. We synthesize recent results to highlight what is currently known about large language model capabilities, thus providing a resource for applied work and for research in adjacent fields that use language models.",language models

challenges and opportunities in deep reinforcement learning with graph neural networks: a comprehensive review of algorithms and applications,"Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has empowered a variety of artificial intelligence fields, including pattern recognition, robotics, recommendation systems, and gaming. Similarly, graph neural networks (GNNs) have also demonstrated their superior performance in supervised learning for graph-structured data. In recent times, the fusion of GNN with DRL for graph-structured environments has attracted a lot of attention. This article provides a comprehensive review of these hybrid works. These works can be classified into two categories: 1) algorithmic contributions, where DRL and GNN complement each other with an objective of addressing each other's shortcomings and 2) application-specific contributions that leverage a combined GNN-DRL formulation to address problems specific to different applications. This fusion effectively addresses various complex problems in engineering and life sciences. Based on the review, we further analyze the applicability and benefits of fusing these two domains, especially in terms of increasing generalizability and reducing computational complexity. Finally, the key challenges in integrating DRL and GNN, and potential future research directions are highlighted, which will be of interest to the broader machine learning community.",graph neural networks reinforcement learning
rgb-d and thermal sensor fusion: a systematic literature review,"In the last decade, the computer vision field has seen significant progress in multimodal data fusion and learning, where multiple sensors, including depth, infrared, and visual, are used to capture the environment across diverse spectral ranges. Despite these advancements, there has been no systematic and comprehensive evaluation of fusing RGB-D and thermal modalities to date. While autonomous driving using LiDAR, radar, RGB, and other sensors has garnered substantial research interest, along with the fusion of RGB and depth modalities, the integration of thermal cameras and, specifically, the fusion of RGB-D and thermal data, has received comparatively less attention. This might be partly due to the limited number of publicly available datasets for such applications. This paper provides a comprehensive review of both, state-of-the-art and traditional methods used in fusing RGB-D and thermal camera data for various applications, such as site inspection, human tracking, fault detection, and others. The reviewed literature has been categorised into technical areas, such as 3D reconstruction, segmentation, object detection, available datasets, and other related topics. Following a brief introduction and an overview of the methodology, the study delves into calibration and registration techniques, then examines thermal visualisation and 3D reconstruction, before discussing the application of classic feature-based techniques and modern deep learning approaches. The paper concludes with a discourse on current limitations and potential future research directions. It is hoped that this survey will serve as a valuable reference for researchers looking to familiarise themselves with the latest advancements and contribute to the RGB-DT research field.",sensor fusion
a survey on location-driven influence maximization,"Influence Maximization (IM), which aims to select a set of users from a social network to maximize the expected number of influenced users, is an evergreen hot research topic. Its research outcomes significantly impact real-world applications such as business marketing. The booming location-based network platforms of the last decade appeal to the researchers embedding the location information into traditional IM research. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of the existing location-driven IM studies from the perspective of the following key aspects: (1) a review of the application scenarios of these works, (2) the diffusion models to evaluate the influence propagation, and (3) a comprehensive study of the approaches to deal with the location-driven IM problems together with a particular focus on the accelerating techniques. In the end, we draw prospects into the research directions in future IM research.",influence maximization
a survey of relevant text mining technology,"Recent advances in text mining and natural language processing technology have enabled researchers to detect an authors identity or demographic characteristics, such as age and gender, in several text genres by automatically analysing the variation of linguistic characteristics. However, applying such techniques in the wild, i.e., in both cybercriminal and regular online social media, differs from more general applications in that its defining characteristics are both domain and process dependent. This gives rise to a number of challenges of which contemporary research has only scratched the surface. More specifically, a text mining approach applied on social media communications typically has no control over the dataset size, the number of available communications will vary across users. Hence, the system has to be robust towards limited data availability. Additionally, the quality of the data cannot be guaranteed. As a result, the approach needs to be tolerant to a certain degree of linguistic noise (for example, abbreviations, non-standard language use, spelling variations and errors). Finally, in the context of cybercriminal fora, it has to be robust towards deceptive or adversarial behaviour, i.e. offenders who attempt to hide their criminal intentions (obfuscation) or who assume a false digital persona (imitation), potentially using coded language. In this work we present a comprehensive survey that discusses the problems that have already been addressed in current literature and review potential solutions. Additionally, we highlight which areas need to be given more attention.",text mining
pre-trained language models in biomedical domain: a systematic survey,"Pre-trained language models (PLMs) have been the de facto paradigm for most natural language processing tasks. This also benefits the biomedical domain: researchers from informatics, medicine, and computer science communities propose various PLMs trained on biomedical datasets, e.g., biomedical text, electronic health records, protein, and DNA sequences for various biomedical tasks. However, the cross-discipline characteristics of biomedical PLMs hinder their spreading among communities; some existing works are isolated from each other without comprehensive comparison and discussions. It is nontrivial to make a survey that not only systematically reviews recent advances in biomedical PLMs and their applications but also standardizes terminology and benchmarks. This article summarizes the recent progress of pre-trained language models in the biomedical domain and their applications in downstream biomedical tasks. Particularly, we discuss the motivations of PLMs in the biomedical domain and introduce the key concepts of pre-trained language models. We then propose a taxonomy of existing biomedical PLMs that categorizes them from various perspectives systematically. Plus, their applications in biomedical downstream tasks are exhaustively discussed, respectively.

Such examples pose a serious threat to the applicability of machine-learning-based systems, especially in life- and safety-critical domains. To address this problem, the area of adversarial robustness investigates mechanisms behind adversarial attacks and defenses against these attacks. This survey reviews a particular subset of this literature that focuses on investigating properties of training data in the context of model robustness under evasion attacks.

augmenting llms with knowledge: a survey on hallucination prevention,"Large pre-trained language models have demonstrated their proficiency in storing factual knowledge within their parameters and achieving remarkable results when fine-tuned for downstream natural language processing tasks. Nonetheless, their capacity to access and manipulate knowledge with precision remains constrained, resulting in performance disparities on knowledge-intensive tasks when compared to task-specific architectures. Additionally, the challenges of providing provenance for model decisions and maintaining up-to-date world knowledge persist as open research frontiers. To address these limitations, the integration of pre-trained models with differentiable access mechanisms to explicit non-parametric memory emerges as a promising solution. This survey delves into the realm of language models (LMs) augmented with the ability to tap into external knowledge sources, including external knowledge bases and search engines. While adhering to the standard objective of predicting missing tokens, these augmented LMs leverage diverse, possibly non-parametric external modules to augment their contextual processing capabilities, departing from the conventional language modeling paradigm. Through an exploration of current advancements in augmenting large language models with knowledge, this work concludes that this emerging research direction holds the potential to address prevalent issues in traditional LMs, such as hallucinations, un-grounded responses, and scalability challenges.",LLM hallucination
robust computer vision in an ever-changing world: a survey of techniques for tackling distribution shifts,"AI applications are becoming increasingly visible to the general public. There is a notable gap between the theoretical assumptions researchers make about computer vision models and the reality those models face when deployed in the real world. One of the critical reasons for this gap is a challenging problem known as distribution shift. Distribution shifts tend to vary with complexity of the data, dataset size, and application type. In our paper, we discuss the identification of such a prominent gap, exploring the concept of distribution shift and its critical significance. We provide an in-depth overview of various types of distribution shifts, elucidate their distinctions, and explore techniques within the realm of the data-centric domain employed to address them. Distribution shifts can occur during every phase of the machine learning pipeline, from the data collection stage to the stage of training a machine learning model to the stage of final model deployment. As a result, it raises concerns about the overall robustness of the machine learning techniques for computer vision applications that are deployed publicly for consumers. Different deep learning models each tailored for specific type of data and tasks, architectural pipelines; highlighting how variations in data preprocessing and feature extraction can impact robustness., data augmentation strategies (e.g. geometric, synthetic and learning-based); demonstrating their role in enhancing model generalization, and training mechanisms (e.g. transfer learning, zero-shot) fall under the umbrella of data-centric methods. Each of these components form an integral part of the neural-network we analyze contributing uniquely to strengthening model robustness against distribution shifts.

a survey of label-efficient deep learning for 3d point clouds,"In the past decade, deep neural networks have achieved significant progress in point cloud learning. However, collecting large-scale precisely-annotated training data is extremely laborious and expensive, which hinders the scalability of existing point cloud datasets and poses a bottleneck for efficient exploration of point cloud data in various tasks and applications. Label-efficient learning offers a promising solution by enabling effective deep network training with much-reduced annotation efforts. This paper presents the first comprehensive survey of label-efficient learning of point clouds. We address three critical questions in this emerging research field: i) the importance and urgency of label-efficient learning in point cloud processing, ii) the subfields it encompasses, and iii) the progress achieved in this area. To achieve this, we propose a taxonomy that organizes label-efficient learning methods based on the data prerequisites provided by different types of labels. We categorize four typical label-efficient learning approaches that significantly reduce point cloud annotation efforts: data augmentation, domain transfer learning, weakly-supervised learning, and pretrained foundation models. For each approach, we outline the problem setup and provide an extensive literature review that showcases relevant progress and challenges. Finally, we share insights into current research challenges and potential future directions.

Despite their huge computational burdens due to the large number of steps involved during sampling, DPMs are widely appreciated in various medical imaging tasks for their high-quality and diversity of generation. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an important medical imaging modality with excellent soft tissue contrast and superb spatial resolution, which possesses unique opportunities for DPMs. Although there is a recent surge of studies exploring DPMs in MRI, a survey paper of DPMs specifically designed for MRI applications is still lacking. This review article aims to help researchers in the MRI community to grasp the advances of DPMs in different applications. We first introduce the theory of two dominant kinds of DPMs, categorized according to whether the diffusion time step is discrete or continuous, and then provide a comprehensive review of emerging DPMs in MRI, including reconstruction, image generation, image translation, segmentation, anomaly detection, and further research topics.

a survey of densest subgraph discovery on large graphs,"With the prevalence of graphs for modeling complex relationships among objects, the topic of graph mining has attracted a great deal of attention from both academic and industrial communities in recent years. As one of the most fundamental problems in graph mining, the densest subgraph discovery (DSD) problem has found a wide spectrum of real applications, such as discovery of filter bubbles in social media, finding groups of actors propagating misinformation in social media, social network community detection, graph index construction, regulatory motif discovery in DNA, fake follower detection, and so on. Theoretically, DSD closely relates to other fundamental graph problems, such as network flow and bipartite matching. Triggered by these applications and connections, DSD has garnered much attention from the database, data mining, theory, and network communities. In this survey, we first highlight the importance of DSD in various real-world applications and the unique challenges that need to be addressed. Subsequently, we classify existing DSD solutions into several groups, which cover around 50 research papers published in many well-known venues (e.g., SIGMOD, PVLDB, TODS, WWW), and conduct a thorough review of these solutions in each group. Afterwards, we analyze and compare the models and solutions in these works. Finally, we point out a list of promising future research directions.

As these recommendation systems increasingly influence user choices, their evaluation transcends mere technical performance and becomes central to business success. This paper addresses the multifaceted nature of recommendation system evaluation by introducing a comprehensive suite of metrics, each tailored to capture a distinct aspect of system performance. We discuss similarity metrics that quantify the precision of content-based and collaborative filtering mechanisms, along with candidate generation metrics which measure how well the system identifies a broad yet pertinent range of items. Following this, we delve into predictive metrics that assess the accuracy of forecasted preferences, ranking metrics that evaluate the order in which recommendations are presented, and business metrics that align system performance with economic objectives. Our approach emphasizes the contextual application of these metrics and their interdependencies. In this paper, we identify the strengths and limitations of current evaluation practices and highlight the nuanced trade-offs that emerge when optimizing recommendation systems across different metrics. The paper concludes by proposing a framework for selecting and interpreting these metrics to not only improve system performance but also to advance business goals.

"a survey of large language models for code: evolution, benchmarking, and future trends","General large language models (LLMs), represented by ChatGPT, have demonstrated significant potential in tasks such as code generation in software engineering. This has led to the development of specialized LLMs for software engineering, known as Code LLMs. A considerable portion of Code LLMs is derived from general LLMs through model fine-tuning. As a result, Code LLMs are often updated frequently and their performance can be influenced by the base LLMs. However, there is currently a lack of systematic investigation into Code LLMs and their performance. In this study, we conduct a comprehensive survey and analysis of the types of Code LLMs and their differences in performance compared to general LLMs. We aim to address three questions: (1) What LLMs are specifically designed for software engineering tasks, and what is the relationship between these Code LLMs? (2) Do Code LLMs really outperform general LLMs in software engineering tasks? (3) Which LLMs are more proficient in different software engineering tasks? To answer these questions, we first collect relevant literature and work from five major databases and open-source communities, resulting in 134 works for analysis. Next, we categorize the Code LLMs based on their publishers and examine their relationships with general LLMs and among themselves. Furthermore, we investigate the performance differences between general LLMs and Code LLMs in various software engineering tasks to demonstrate the impact of base models and Code LLMs. Finally, we comprehensively maintained the performance of LLMs across multiple mainstream benchmarks to identify the best-performing LLMs for each software engineering task. Our research not only assists developers of Code LLMs in choosing base models for the development of more advanced LLMs but also provides insights for practitioners to better understand key improvement directions for Code LLMs.",large language models for code

generalized out-of-distribution detection: a survey,"Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is critical to ensuring the reliability and safety of machine learning systems. For instance, in autonomous driving, we would like the driving system to issue an alert and hand over the control to humans when it detects unusual scenes or objects that it has never seen during training time and cannot make a safe decision. The term, OOD detection, first emerged in 2017 and since then has received increasing attention from the research community, leading to a plethora of methods developed, ranging from classification-based to density-based to distance-based ones. Meanwhile, several other problems, including anomaly detection (AD), novelty detection (ND), open set recognition (OSR), and outlier detection (OD), are closely related to OOD detection in terms of motivation and methodology. Despite common goals, these topics develop in isolation, and their subtle differences in definition and problem setting often confuse readers and practitioners. In this survey, we first present a unified framework called generalized OOD detection, which encompasses the five aforementioned problems, i.e., AD, ND, OSR, OOD detection, and OD. Under our framework, these five problems can be seen as special cases or sub-tasks, and are easier to distinguish. We then review each of these five areas by summarizing their recent technical developments, with a special focus on OOD detection methodologies.

In this study, we aim to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the similarities and differences among approaches to sociodemographic bias in NLP. To better understand the distinction between bias and real-world harm, we turn to ideas from psychology and behavioral economics to propose a definition for sociodemographic bias. We identify three main categories of NLP bias research: types of bias, quantifying bias, and debiasing techniques. We highlight the current trends in quantifying bias and debiasing techniques, offering insights into their strengths and weaknesses. We conclude that current approaches on quantifying bias face reliability issues, that many of the bias metrics do not relate to real-world bias, and that debiasing techniques need to focus more on training methods. Finally, we provide recommendations for future work.",sociodemographic bias

A large number of valuable reviews are continually being posted, describing software problems and expected features. Effectively utilizing user reviews necessitates the extraction of relevant information, as well as their subsequent summarization. Due to the substantial volume of user reviews, manual analysis is arduous. Various approaches based on natural language processing (NLP) have been proposed for automatic user review mining. However, the majority of them requires a manually crafted dataset to train their models, which limits their usage in real-world scenarios. In this work, we propose Mini-BAR, a tool that integrates large language models (LLMs) to perform zero-shot mining of user reviews in both English and French. Specifically, Mini-BAR is designed to (i) classify the user reviews, (ii) cluster similar reviews together, (iii) generate an abstractive summary for each cluster and (iv) rank the user review clusters.

a survey on graph representation learning methods,"Graphs representation learning has been a very active research area in recent years. The goal of graph representation learning is to generate graph representation vectors that capture the structure and features of large graphs accurately. This is especially important because the quality of the graph representation vectors will affect the performance of these vectors in downstream tasks such as node classification, link prediction and anomaly detection. Many techniques have been proposed for generating effective graph representation vectors, which generally fall into two categories: traditional graph embedding methods and graph neural nets (GNN) based methods. These methods can be applied to both static and dynamic graphs. A static graph is a single fixed graph, while a dynamic graph evolves over time and its nodes and edges can be added or deleted from the graph. In this survey, we review the graph embedding methods in both traditional and GNN-based categories for both static and dynamic graphs and include the recent papers published until the time of submission. In addition, we summarize a number of limitations of GNNs and the proposed solutions to these limitations. Such a summary has not been provided in previous surveys.

federated learning for privacy preservation in smart healthcare systems: a comprehensive survey,"Recent advances in electronic devices and communication infrastructure have revolutionized the traditional healthcare system into a smart healthcare system by using internet of medical things (IoMT) devices. However, due to the centralized training approach of artificial intelligence (AI), mobile and wearable IoMT devices raise privacy issues concerning the information communicated between hospitals and end-users. The information conveyed by the IoMT devices is highly confidential and can be exposed to adversaries. In this regard, federated learning (FL), a distributive AI paradigm, has opened up new opportunities for privacy preservation in IoMT without accessing the confidential data of the participants. Further, FL provides privacy to end-users as only gradients are shared during training. For these specific properties of FL, in this paper, we present privacy-related issues in IoMT.

"artificial empathy classification: a survey of deep learning techniques, datasets, and evaluation scales","From the last decade, researchers in the field of machine learning (ML) and assistive developmental robotics (ADR) have taken an interest in artificial empathy (AE) as a possible future paradigm for human-robot interaction (HRI). Humans learn empathy since birth, therefore, it is challenging to instill this sense in robots and intelligent machines. Nevertheless, by training over a vast amount of data and time, imitating empathy, to a certain extent, can be possible for robots. Training techniques for AE, along with findings from the field of empathetic AI research, are ever-evolving. The standard workflow for artificial empathy consists of three stages: 1) Emotion Recognition (ER) using the retrieved features from video or textual data, 2) analyzing the perceived emotion or degree of empathy to choose the best course of action, and 3) carrying out a response action. Recent studies that show AE being used with virtual agents or robots often include Deep Learning (DL) techniques. For instance, models like VGGFace are used to conduct ER. Semi-supervised models like Autoencoders generate the corresponding emotional states and behavioral responses. However, there has not been any study that presents an independent approach for evaluating AE, or the degree to which a reaction was empathetic. This paper aims to investigate and evaluate existing works for measuring and evaluating empathy, as well as the datasets that have been collected and used so far. Our goal is to highlight and facilitate the use of state-of-the-art methods in the area of AE by comparing their performance.

As such they are naturally amenable to data-driven research methodologies. The data from sensors and monitors inside the accelerator form multivariate time series. With fast pre-emptive approaches being highly preferred in accelerator control and diagnostics, the application of data-driven time series forecasting methods is particularly promising. This review formulates the time series forecasting problem and summarizes existing models with applications in various scientific areas. Several current and future attempts in the field of particle accelerators are introduced. The application of time series forecasting to particle accelerators has shown encouraging results and the promise for broader use, and existing problems such as data consistency and compatibility have started to be addressed.",time series forecasting
on efficient training of large-scale deep learning models: a literature review,"The field of deep learning has witnessed significant progress, particularly in computer vision (CV), natural language processing (NLP), and speech. The use of large-scale models trained on vast amounts of data holds immense promise for practical applications, enhancing industrial productivity and facilitating social development. With the increasing demands on computational capacity, though numerous studies have explored the efficient training, a comprehensive summarization on acceleration techniques of training deep learning models is still much anticipated. In this survey, we present a detailed review for training acceleration. We consider the fundamental update formulation and split its basic components into five main perspectives: (1) data-centric: including dataset regularization, data sampling, and data-centric curriculum learning techniques, which can significantly reduce the computational complexity of the data samples; (2) model-centric, including acceleration of basic modules, compression training, model initialization and model-centric curriculum learning techniques, which focus on accelerating the training via reducing the calculations on parameters; (3) optimization-centric, including the selection of learning rate, the employment of large batchsize, the designs of efficient objectives, and model average techniques, which pay attention to the training policy and improving the generality for the large-scale models; (4) budgeted training, including some distinctive acceleration methods on source-constrained situations; (5) system-centric, including some efficient open-source distributed libraries/systems which provide adequate hardware support for the implementation of acceleration algorithms. By presenting this comprehensive taxonomy, our survey presents a comprehensive review to understand the general mechanisms within each component and their joint interaction.",large-scale model efficient training
trustworthy llms: a survey and guideline for evaluating large language models' alignment,"Ensuring alignment, which refers to making models behave in accordance with human intentions [1,2], has become a critical task before deploying large language models (LLMs) in real-world applications. For instance, OpenAI devoted six months to iteratively aligning GPT-4 before its release [3]. However, a major challenge faced by practitioners is the lack of clear guidance on evaluating whether LLM outputs align with social norms, values, and regulations. This obstacle hinders systematic iteration and deployment of LLMs. To address this issue, this paper presents a comprehensive survey of key dimensions that are crucial to consider when assessing LLM trustworthiness. The survey covers seven major categories of LLM trustworthiness: reliability, safety, fairness, resistance to misuse, explainability and reasoning, adherence to social norms, and robustness. Each major category is further divided into several sub-categories, resulting in a total of 29 sub-categories. Additionally, a subset of 8 sub-categories is selected for further investigation, where corresponding measurement studies are designed and conducted on several widely-used LLMs. The measurement results indicate that, in general, more aligned models tend to perform better in terms of overall trustworthiness. However, the effectiveness of alignment varies across the different trustworthiness categories considered. This highlights the importance of conducting more fine-grained analyses, testing, and making continuous improvements on LLM alignment. By shedding light on these key dimensions of LLM trustworthiness, this paper aims to provide valuable insights and guidance to practitioners in the field. Understanding and addressing these concerns will be crucial in achieving reliable and ethically sound deployment of LLMs in various applications.",trustworthiness LLMs

"a survey on text-to-sql parsing: concepts, methods, and future directions","Text-to-SQL parsing is an essential and challenging task. The goal of text-to-SQL parsing is to convert a natural language (NL) question to its corresponding structured query language (SQL) based on the evidences provided by relational databases. Early text-to-SQL parsing systems from the database community achieved a noticeable progress with the cost of heavy human engineering and user interactions with the systems. In recent years, deep neural networks have significantly advanced this task by neural generation models, which automatically learn a mapping function from an input NL question to an output SQL query. Subsequently, the large pre-trained language models have taken the state-of-the-art of the text-to-SQL parsing task to a new level. In this survey, we present a comprehensive review on deep learning approaches for text-to-SQL parsing. First, we introduce the text-to-SQL parsing corpora which can be categorized as single-turn and multi-turn. Second, we provide a systematical overview of pre-trained language models and existing methods for text-to-SQL parsing. Third, we present readers with the challenges faced by text-to-SQL parsing and explore some potential future directions in this field.",text-to-SQL
deep generative models in engineering design: a review," Automated design synthesis has the potential to revolutionize the modern engineering design process and improve access to highly optimized and customized products across countless industries. Successfully adapting generative Machine Learning to design engineering may enable such automated design synthesis and is a research subject of great importance. We present a review and analysis of Deep Generative Learning models in engineering design. Deep Generative Models (DGMs) typically leverage deep networks to learn from an input dataset and synthesize new designs. Recently, DGMs such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), feedforward Neural Networks (NNs) and certain Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) frameworks have shown promising results in design applications like structural optimization, materials design, and shape synthesis. The prevalence of DGMs in Engineering Design has skyrocketed since 2016. Anticipating continued growth, we conduct a review of recent advances with the hope of benefitting researchers interested in DGMs for design. We structure our review as an exposition of the algorithms, datasets, representation methods, and applications commonly used in the current literature. In particular, we discuss key works that have introduced new techniques and methods in DGMs, successfully applied DGMs to a design-related domain, or directly supported development of DGMs through datasets or auxiliary methods. We further identify key challenges and limitations currently seen in DGMs across design fields, such as design creativity, handling constraints and objectives, and modeling both form and functional performance simultaneously. In our discussion we identify possible solution pathways as key areas on which to target future work.",deep generative models
alzheimer's disease detection from spontaneous speech and text: a review,"In the past decade, there has been a surge in research examining the use of voice and speech analysis as a means of detecting neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's. Many studies have shown that certain acoustic features can be used to differentiate between normal aging and Alzheimer's disease, and speech analysis has been found to be a cost-effective method of detecting Alzheimer's dementia. The aim of this review is to analyze the various algorithms used in speech-based detection and classification of Alzheimer's disease. A literature survey was conducted using databases such as Web of Science, Google Scholar, and Science Direct, and articles published from January 2020 to the present were included based on keywords such as ``Alzheimer's detection'',""speech,""and""natural language processing.""The ADReSS, Pitt corpus, and CCC datasets are commonly used for the analysis of dementia from speech, and this review focuses on the various acoustic and linguistic feature engineering-based classification models drawn from 15 studies. Based on the findings of this study, it appears that a more accurate model for classifying Alzheimer's disease can be developed by considering both linguistic and acoustic data. The review suggests that speech signals can be a useful tool for detecting dementia and may serve as a reliable biomarker for efficiently identifying Alzheimer's disease.",Alzheimers disease detection
the sentiment problem: a critical survey towards deconstructing sentiment analysis,"We conduct an inquiry into the sociotechnical aspects of sentiment analysis (SA) by critically examining 189 peer-reviewed papers on their applications, models, and datasets. Our investigation stems from the recognition that SA has become an integral component of diverse sociotechnical systems, exerting influence on both social and technical users. By delving into sociological and technological literature on sentiment, we unveil distinct conceptualizations of this term in domains such as finance, government, and medicine. Our study exposes a lack of explicit definitions and frameworks for characterizing sentiment, resulting in potential challenges and biases. To tackle this issue, we propose an ethics sheet encompassing critical inquiries to guide practitioners in ensuring equitable utilization of SA. Our findings underscore the significance of adopting an interdisciplinary approach to defining sentiment in SA and offer a pragmatic solution for its implementation.",sentiment analysis
A Survey of Historical Learning: Learning Models with Learning History,"New knowledge originates from the old. The various types of elements, deposited in the training history, are a large amount of wealth for improving learning deep models. In this survey, we comprehensively review and summarize the topic--``Historical Learning: Learning Models with Learning History'', which learns better neural models with the help of their learning history during its optimization, from three detailed aspects: Historical Type (what), Functional Part (where) and Storage Form (how). To our best knowledge, it is the first survey that systematically studies the methodologies which make use of various historical statistics when training deep neural networks. The discussions with related topics like recurrent/memory networks, ensemble learning, and reinforcement learning are demonstrated. We also expose future challenges of this topic and encourage the community to pay attention to the think of historical learning principles when designing algorithms.
