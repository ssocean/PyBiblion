## Introduction

This repository contains the official code implementation for the Paper [A Literature Review of Literature Reviews in Pattern Analysis and Machine
Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12928). Our goal is to provide a set of tools to assist researchers and scholars in conducting efficient and in-depth bibliometric analyses in the field.

## Features

- **Meta-data Retrieval**: Automated tools for fetching literature data from multiple databases.
- **Data Analysis**: Offers a variety of literature data analysis tools, including but not limited to keyword extraction, and metric calculation.
- **Visualization**: Generates intuitive charts and diagrams to help understand the distribution and relationships within the literature data.
- **Extensibility**: The code is structured clearly, making it easy for other researchers to modify and extend according to their needs.
## Update 
## News and Updates
* 2024.04.25 🔥 We've got the latest Langchain framework and OpenAI 1.0 version on board now, making everything GPT-related run smoother and faster.
